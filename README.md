# Subscription Onboarding App

This project is a React application built with TypeScript, designed to manage a subscription onboarding process.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, you'll need to start both the backend server and the React development server.

### 1. Start the Backend Server

First, navigate to the ```/src``` directory within the project and run the server:

```bash
cd subscription-onboarding/src
node server.js
```

Note: The necessary code you that you will need to continue with the subscription path you will find it displayed in this terminal whenever you get to that step.

### 2. Run the React Application

Once your server is running, open a new terminal tab. Navigate back to the main ```/subscription-onboarding``` directory, and then start the React app:

```bash
cd subscription-onboarding
npm start
```

This command will open the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000 (if available).
